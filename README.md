# Agroverse-motion-forecasting
This is the code to a grad-level course competition @ UCSD CSE 251B. Visit the competition page at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ucsd-cse-251b-class-competition/overview

The implementation of this project is largely advised by the ideas from the original Agroverse paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02620
